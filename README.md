# Horus Behavioural Tracking (experimental)

## Real-Time Eye Tracking & Behavioral Signal Exploration

This is **personal, experimental project** explores real-time eye tracking and higher-level behavioral signal extraction.

The focus is on:
- understanding eye-movement dynamics over time
- mapping low-level computer vision outputs to interpretable behavioral signals
- experimenting with real-time visualization, scoring, and event detection
